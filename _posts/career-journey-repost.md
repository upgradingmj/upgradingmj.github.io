# Welcome

Skilling up and learning new things related to IT and Cybersecurity

Hello Everyone,

I'm farily new at using Git and will hopefully be updating this slowly as time goes on.

Who am I?

I am Majdy Al-aktam, also known as "MJ" by many co-workers and professional connections. I've worked in the IT industry since around August of 2018 and at this current moment and time I'm seeking to grow my skills to hopefully get to where I need to go.

My Experience:

I started off my career working with Apple and quite literally getting my hands involved with MacOs which is a bit unorthodox since most people predominately are diving into Windows. I was a support advisor for about 2 years and worked on the iOS and MAC team for escalations for the general public. I loved that job because I met people from all over the world and it taught me the importance of customer service is.

From there I moved onto working at my first MSSP and started off as a MacOS Servicedesk Admin for a global company and then slowly transitioned into a SOC. Working as a SOC Analyst. During this role I understood what SIEM's are and understood the basic's of detection engineering since I would be mostly eye's and ears but would slowly dive into SIEM logic to help better optimize resources for more accurate threat detection. I've worked with LogRhythm, Q-Radar, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and many more I can't think of. I've also used tools such as Ironscales and during this time I took an interest into the Identity and Access Management world so I would constantly bug and hang out with the engineers on that group (Shoutout to you William!) and got interested in Okta tech since this was the biggest tech being deployed at the time during Covid. Of course my lack of expertise at times showed but I was very much interested. I took a shot at the Okta Certifed Professional Exam at this time and failed by 2 questions. I have thought about trying this again very soon of course as I write this.

After that I've worked at a startup under the CEO as the right hand man, working on a variety of tools and even got into sales and account management. During this role I was a mix of an IT Specialist, Desktop Support, and learned the basics of VoIP since I was deploying it and selling it.

From there I was fourloughed during Covid in 2020 and a month letter ended up working at Centaris (an MSP transitioning to be an MSSP), I started off on the service desk for a few months and very quickly I was moved up to become a security administrator. From there I learned the other side of working with tools instead of just the analysis piece which I've done in the past. I've deployed MDR/EDR, DNSSEC Solutions, and Email Security tools that sat ontop of M365 and Google Workspace. I was also responsible for managing our Security Awareness training platform.

This was a unique role since I wasn't just a security admin even though I was on paper. I was responsible for many different things across the organization such as combating tribal knowledge since our team was constantly exposed to new information and we had to make descisions that would impact the whole organization. This included not only creating knowledge base articles and maintaining a ever so growing knowledge base. This also included jumping into different meetings with teams and providing updates on our approach (both to technical staff such as the service desk and field service engineers as well as non-technical staff such as the sales team to help develop better pre-sales strategies to help promote better security hygiene when offering managed services). I would frequently be a guest for client facing webinars talking about different cybersecurity topics related to AI, Email security, MFA, Password Management tools and different things in the IAM space as well. This was on the side of being an escalations resource for all security related issues related to our toolset. I got my feet wet as well in the project engineering world since I was first part-timing as a project engineer and deploying all our tools to clients and eventually then mentoring the project engineering team by providing such documentation to them and showing them best practices overtime to let them take over so I can focus on other internal efforts. I would be in meetings with clients and constantly be a point of contact for any and all questions to ensure things went smoothly until completion. Futhermore, our group was transitioning to a SecOPs unit during this time and we were combined with not only the security admin group (which included me) but also the incident response side. So our efforts while they differinated we were apart of one team and during this peroid we would assist with incidents to ensure our tools were deployed to clients and to help deploy any counter measures that we had on hand if possible to clients when they were faced with a breach. This took our group really to making security proactive as we were constantly facing fires to put out which allowed us to make our case to the C-suite part of the organization of the importance of standardization and security automation. I also helped in some incident response efforts such as conditional access modification requests, investigating bruteforce login attempts on servers, along with a few other things related to account compromise and email security related issues.

So where am I at Now??

Currently I'm unemployed due to a complicated situation that invovled me needing to pickup and move across the globe. So I wasn't able to take my previous work with me and I'll be in this position for sometime.

What do you do these days?

I've bought a Mini PC and turned it into a NAS running TrueNAS. I've automated time machine backups from my Mac and also have been slowly getting my feet wet with docker by deploying services that I'm slowly finding useful in my day to day workflow. I've also setup my own VPN tunnel to get back into my home to access these services while I'm out and about remotely.
I'm kicking my feet around if I should start a tech blog related to homelabbing since I'm fairly new but it's really interesting stuff and I feel I'm learning alot and it's teaching me about security in the process.
I'm slowly working through boot.dev, theodinproject to learn some backend skills (although this is a struggle and I'm finding myself going back to understanding functions constantly xD).
Of course most importantly I am applying for Jobs.
You may have also noticed that I also have my own Freelancing Gig from my website upgradingmj.com. I do offer some tech support along with other services to clients, primiarly I promote myself on Upwork but that's spotty, so I'm hoping to learn some skills in the meantime.
