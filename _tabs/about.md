# Hi

I'm Majdy Al-Aktam, also known as MJ, Hence the name for this website "upgradingmj". 

The "upgrading" piece is me learning and growing in my tech career while documenting along the way. 

I've yapped quite a bit about my career-journey on my github page (which I may repost on here at somepoint).

Give a follow to me on my Github and Linkedln!

Thanks for reading!
