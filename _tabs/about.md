# Hi

I'm Majdy Al-Aktam, also known as MJ, Hence the name for this website "upgradingmj". 

The "upgrading" piece is me learning and growing in my tech career while documenting along the way. As I'm currently looking for oppurtunities in the tech field (IT & Cybersecurity) but am looking to expand my skills to slowly learn how to code as well to make myself more marketable. 

This website is to aid with that goal in mind as I've had no way or evidence to document my projects I've completed in the past.

I've yapped quite a bit about my career-journey on my github page (which I may repost on here at somepoint).

Give a follow to me on my Github and Linkedln!

Thanks for reading!
