Hello!

Welcome to my tech blog! This really is just a portfolio site of all my ramblings of

- Things that I learned (or am still learning and breaking)
- Cool homelab projects I want to document about
- Thoughts and other things related certain topics in cybersecurity.

TLDR: This job market is cooked and I'm looking a way to skill up. This is to hopefully help with that.
